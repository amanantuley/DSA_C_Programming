## 📂 **Data Structures Implemented**

- **Arrays**: Basic operations (insertion, deletion, traversal, searching, sorting).
- **Stacks**: Implementation using arrays and linked lists, stack operations.
- **Queues**: Circular queue, priority queue, and double-ended queue (Deque).
- **Linked Lists**: Single, double, and circular linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees.
- **Graphs**: Adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations, BFS and DFS traversals.
